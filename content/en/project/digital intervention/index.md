 Being known as one of the primary format of low intensity intervention, digital psychological intervention is full of promise to bridge the mental health gap. Together with my collaborators, we developed a Wechat applet program to help Chinese university students cope with their depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of this self-help program is to be examined soon and please stay tuned.
 
 We also pay attention to another vulnerable group, the women in the perinatal period. These to-be-moms or new moms may go through suffering during the labor process and it can trigger their previous traumatic experience. Mental health care is needed in this group. A project using digital device to soothe the anxiety and prevent devastation due to the birth trauma is on the way.
